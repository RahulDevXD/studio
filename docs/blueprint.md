## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant yellow (#FFC107) to symbolize optimism, energy, and accessibility, reflecting the potential benefits the app provides.
- Background color: Light yellow (#FFF8E1), a very lightly saturated version of the primary color for a bright and clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800), a slightly brighter analogous color to the primary yellow, used for call-to-action buttons and important highlights, ensuring they stand out.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, offering a blend of modernity and warmth, suitable for both headlines and body text, making the app user-friendly and readable.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, representative icons for categories such as agriculture, education, and health, following a flat design style with consistent line weights. Icons will use the primary or accent color.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout to present schemes. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter, with clear visual hierarchy to guide the user.
- Implement subtle animations, such as a smooth transition or fade-in effect, when loading new scheme details or filtering results. Keep animations brief and functional to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
